# -Smart-Dustbin-Data-Science-Project
# 🚮 Smart Dustbin –  Data Science Project + IOT 

An IoT and data-driven smart waste management system that simulates sensor data from dustbins, visualizes real-time fill levels, and predicts future bin status using machine learning.

---

## 📌 Project Summary

This project was inspired by IBM's waste management problem statement and simulates how a smart dustbin can be equipped with ultrasonic sensors to detect fill levels. It uses Python and data science tools to analyze trends and forecast when the bin will be full — helping optimize waste collection scheduling in smart cities.

## 🎓 My Role as a Data Science Student

As the data science contributor, I:

- Designed and implemented the simulation logic for bin fill levels using Python
- Used **Pandas** to process and analyze time-series fill data
- Applied **Linear Regression** with **scikit-learn** to predict when the bin will reach 100% capacity
- Created clear visualizations using **Matplotlib**
- Generated graphs and model outputs that demonstrate real-world decision support for municipal services
